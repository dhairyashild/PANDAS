## Explanation:
- **Scikit-learn** focuses on classical ML tasks: preprocessing, algorithm selection, training, evaluation, and tuning.
- It does **not support**: problem definition, data collection/storage, deployment, monitoring, or orchestration.
- Industry uses specialized frameworks and platforms for these other crucial steps in the ML lifecycle.
- This table provides a holistic view of where Scikit-learn fits within the ML project lifecycle and what tools are commonly used at other steps.
