Task: Log metrics/artifacts.

python
Copy
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_metric("val_loss", 0.123)
    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
Kubeflow Pipelines

Learn: Kubeflow Pipelines

Task: Schedule retraining jobs.

Deliverable:
Trained TFT model in MLflow Registry.

Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (Week 7-8)
Goals:
Deploy low-latency inference.

Monitor model performance.

Tools & Learning Resources:
Seldon Core

Learn: Seldon Deployments

Task: Deploy model as REST API.

yaml
Copy
# Helm install
helm install seldon-core seldon-core-operator
FastAPI

Learn: FastAPI Tutorial

Task: Build trade signal API.

python
Copy
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(features: dict):
    return model.predict(features)
Prometheus + Grafana

Learn: Prometheus Querying

Task: Monitor prediction latency/drift.

Deliverable:
Model serving at <your-api>/predict with monitoring.

Phase 5: Execution & Backtesting (Week 9-10)
Goals:
Execute paper trades.

Validate strategy.

Tools & Learning Resources:
Backtrader

Learn: Backtrader Docs

Task: Backtest with slippage/transaction costs.

python
Copy
cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy)
cerebro.run()
Zerodha Kite API

Learn: Kite Connect Docs

Task: Place mock orders.

Redis Streams

Learn: Redis Streams

Task: Queue orders for fault tolerance.

Deliverable:
Backtested strategy with Sharpe ratio > 1.5.

Phase 6: CI/CD & Automation (Week 11-12)
Goals:
Automate retraining/deployment.

Ensure reproducibility.

Tools & Learning Resources:
GitHub Actions

Learn: GitHub Actions

Task: Trigger retraining on data drift.

yaml
Copy
# .github/workflows/retrain.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
jobs:
  retrain:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: python retrain.py
DVC

Learn: DVC Tutorial

Task: Version datasets/models.

Deliverable:
End-to-end automated pipeline (data â†’ train â†’ deploy).

Pro Tips for DevOps
Start Small:

Begin with a single model (e.g., SMA crossover) to validate the pipeline.

Chaos Engineering:

Use Gremlin to test Kafka/DB failures.

Cost Control:

Use Spot Instances for Spark/Kubeflow.
